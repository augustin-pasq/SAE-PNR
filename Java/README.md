# Java application

## Dependencies

- [Java](https://www.java.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)

## Build instructions

There is a script to easily build and run the application:

```bash
# Build and run the application
./maker run [--verbose, --file <file>]

# Only build the application
./maker build [--verbose]

# Generate the documentation
./maker doc

# List all available commands
./maker help
```

**For Windows users**, simply replace `./maker` with `.\maker.exe` with the same commands.

There are no dependencies to this script.
